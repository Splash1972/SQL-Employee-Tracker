# SQL-Employee-Tracker

This is for Project Week 12, a CLI program that connects to a database with PostgreSQL.

As a user, you can use the prompts to view a department, role, or employee and a table will display in the console.

Also, you can add to the list of departments, employees, and roles.

All of the information will be stored in the database that I've created, called employee_db.  I use DBeaver to view the tables as well.

Technologies used: Node, express, Postgres
